# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: started 2die2sleep which uses d3.js to represent all the grotesque ways Shakespearean characters die

**Thoughts:** Built out the models for the DB of plays/victims/perpetrators, still trying to figure out every nec. field but believe I have a good foundation. Not even touching front end or routes atm, totally focused on models and seed file. I admit I've been spending a LOT of time researching the content to put in the seed, but I really don't think I'll stay motivated if I don't have a really solid body of research. I just need to make sure I don't use it as a way to avoid actual coding

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
