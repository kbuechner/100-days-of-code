# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: started 2die2sleep which uses d3.js to represent all the grotesque ways Shakespearean characters die

**Thoughts:** Built out the models for the DB of plays/victims/perpetrators, still trying to figure out every nec. field but believe I have a good foundation. Not even touching front end or routes atm, totally focused on models and seed file. I admit I've been spending a LOT of time researching the content to put in the seed, but I really don't think I'll stay motivated if I don't have a really solid body of research. I just need to make sure I don't use it as a way to avoid actual coding

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: worked on building models for 2die2sleep

**Thoughts:** Skipped Jan 9. Built out one model officially, figured out one could be removed and just created as a join table, worked on it anyway, trying to drag this out w/out getting to middleware ever. Middleware is boring. I can do it, but it's the least fun. 

That's why I've got to do it.

Finish the models tomorrow. Thursday: Let's Get Express On (ughhhh)
